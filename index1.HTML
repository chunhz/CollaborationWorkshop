  <h1><b>Covid-19 Plasma Donations</b></h1>
  
  <p>In coordination with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 
the CUNY Health Club is seeking people who are fully recovered from the new 
coronavirus to sign up to donate plasma to help current COVID-19 patients.</p>

<p>People who have fully recovered from COVID-19 have antibodies in their
 plasma that can attack the virus. This convalescent plasma is being evaluated as
 treatment for patients with serious or immediately life-threatening COVID-19 infections, 
 or those judged by a healthcare   
provider to be at high risk of progression to severe or life-threatening disease.</p>

<p>You may qualify to donate plasma for coronavirus patients if you meet specific convalescent plasma and regular blood donation eligibility requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>You are at least 17 years old and weigh 110 lbs. Additional weight requirements apply for donors age 18 or younger.</li>

<li>In good health. You generally feel well, even if you're being treated for a chronic condition.</li>

<li>Have a prior, verified diagnosis of COVID-19, but are now symptom free and fully recovered from COVID-19.</li>
