  <h1><b>Covid-19 Plasma Donations</b></h1>
  
  <p>In coordination with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 
the CUNY Health Club is seeking people who are fully recovered from the new 
coronavirus to sign up to donate plasma to help current COVID-19 patients.</p>

<p>People who have fully recovered from COVID-19 have antibodies in their
 plasma that can attack the virus. This convalescent plasma is being evaluated as
 treatment for patients with serious or immediately life-threatening COVID-19 infections, 
 or those judged by a healthcare   
provider to be at high risk of progression to severe or life-threatening disease.</p>
